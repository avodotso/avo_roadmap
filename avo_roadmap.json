Second, to addressing critical feedback from the alpha testing phase and other issues discovered in the process.\n\nDev comments: Some parts of the app were clunky - especially with graphing components (on the agent page and on the pool page). Navigation between pages felt clunky. This is optimization that requires some parts to be rewritten. Not to mention, this changes between Android and iOS and between different phones so right now I have a good idea of what's not smooth and what needs to be addressed on a technical level. However, I am realising these challenges will likely continue to come up with a public rollout.\n\nSometimes social onboarding doesn't work and sometimes the token times out. Which I suspect is because there's mis-configuration between our gateway (what serves the data) and privy on mobile. This was honestly the fastest way to roll out auth without rewriting the gateway but I realized it's probably a better idea rewriting the gateway service to work directly with privy as its auth layer.\n\nUnrelated to mobile, but there are some critical infrastructure layer updates that need to be rolled out - this will delay time spent on devving the mobile app.",
